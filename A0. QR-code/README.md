## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- @import
- :root
- @media query
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive Image

### What I learned

This is the first time I made copy of a project. It was not easy to judge width, height, padding and all other parameters from an image. I tried to make it as same as I can at this time.

I didn't use _fevicon_ till now so I got the chance to work with it. I took the help of *w3schools* for this.

Also, this is the fist time I made a background design. And luckily it didn't took much time :) Now I will make more designs.

#### New Changes

I commit changes after learning new things like responsive image using **max-width**, use of **vw**, **%** in media query. Also give card a rotating transform. 

### Continued development

This is my first submission in **Frontendmentor** and I'm ready to make more. Mistakes helped me learn in my journey so I'm not afraid of these. Hope I will learn more and more.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to use fevicon.
