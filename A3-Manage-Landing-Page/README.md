**Brad Traversy**

I wanted to start my **Tailwind** journey. But I was having trouble with it. And luckily I found Brad's video on youtube. It helped me to setup Tailwind and I started learning from his video.

He made video on the same project, but did not give exact style project demanded. And that's a really good thing about his video. He didn't to teach you how to walk, he teach you how to keep your first steps. Rest is on you.

**Ecem Gokdogan**

I am learning a lot from Ecem's projects. Her consistency is inspiring.

I got to know about "author" and "keywords" tag which I am adding in all of my projects.

Same for profile count in GitHub, I add it after I saw it in her profile.
