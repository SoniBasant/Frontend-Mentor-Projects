## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

Along with the above features, I also add some more.

- Receive an error message when password is not sufficiently long. The message for this error will say _"Password is too short"_. Here the length of password should be atleast 6.
- When input field is as per the guidelines, border will become _green_ and you will see green check mark at the right side of input.
