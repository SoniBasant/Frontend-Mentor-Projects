## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive on Mobile Screen

### What I learned

I use _picture_ tag first time. This is used to display different images at different screen size.

I customized design of desktop preview from previous project so it take much lesser time than the previous one.

### Continued development

This is my second submission in **Frontendmentor** and I'm ready to make more. Learnings from first project was very helpful . Hope I will learn more and more.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to use _picture_ tag.
